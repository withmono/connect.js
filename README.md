# Mono Connect.js

Mono Connect.js is a quick and secure way to link bank accounts to Mono from within your app. Mono Connect is a drop-in framework that handles connecting a financial institution to your app (credential validation, multi-factor authentication, error handling, etc). It works with all major javascript frameworks.

For accessing customer accounts and interacting with Mono's API (Identity, Transactions, Income, DirectPay) use the server-side [Mono API](https://docs.mono.co/docs/intro-to-mono-api).

### <a name="key"></a> `key`
**Required**  
This is your Mono public API key from the [Mono dashboard](https://app.withmono.com/apps).
```js
new Connect({ key: 'mono_public_key', scope: 'auth' });
```

### <a name="customer"></a> `Customer`
**Required**  

```js
// you can pass id of an existing mono customer
// const customer = { id: '611aa53041247f2801efb222' } // mono customer id

// or create a new mono customer
const customer = {
  name: 'Samuel Olumide',
  email: 'samuel.olumide@gmail.com',
  identity: {
    type: 'bvn',
    number: '2323233239'
  },
}

new Connect({ 
  key: 'mono_public_key',
  scope: 'auth',
  data: { customer },
});
```

### <a name="onSuccess"></a> `onSuccess`      
**Required**
This function is called when a user has successfully onboarded their account. It should take a single String argument containing the token that can be [exchanged for an account id](https://docs.mono.co/reference/authentication-endpoint).
```js
new Connect({
  key: 'mono_public_key',
  scope: 'auth',
  data: { customer },
  onSuccess: (data) => {
    // in the case of authentication auth code is returned
    console.log("auth code", data.code);
    // in the case of direct debit payments
    // a charge object is return containing amount, transaction_reference, type...
    console.log("charge object", data);
  }
});
```

### <a name="onClose"></a> `onClose`
The optional closure is called when a user has specifically exited the Mono Connect flow (i.e. the widget is not visible to the user). It does not take any arguments.
```js
new Connect({
  key: 'mono_public_key',
  scope: 'auth',
  data: { customer },
  onSuccess: ({code}) => console.log("auth code", code),
  onClose: () => console.log("widget has been closed")
});
```

### <a name="onLoad"></a> `onLoad`
This function is invoked the widget has been mounted unto the DOM. You can handle toggling your trigger button within this callback.
```js
new Connect({
  key: 'mono_public_key',
  scope: 'auth',
  data: { customer },
  onSuccess: ({code}) => console.log("auth code", code),
  onLoad: () => console.log("widget loaded successfully")
});
```

### <a name="onEvent"></a> `onEvent`
This optional function is called when certain events in the Mono Connect flow have occurred, for example, when the user selected an institution. This enables your application to gain further insight into the Mono Connect onboarding flow.

See the [data](#dataObject) object below for details.

```js
new Connect({
  key: 'mono_public_key',
  scope: 'auth',
  data: { customer },
  onSuccess: ({code}) => console.log("auth code", code),
  onEvent: (eventName, data) => {
    console.log(eventName);
    console.log(data);
  }
});
```

### <a name="reference"></a> `reference`
This optional string is used as a reference to the current instance of Mono Connect. It will be passed to the data object in all onEvent callbacks. It's recommended to pass a random string.


```js
new Connect({
  key: 'mono_public_key',
  scope: 'auth',
  data: { customer },
  onSuccess: ({code}) => console.log("auth code", code),
  reference: "some_random_string"
});
```

### <a name="setupConfig"></a> `setupConfig`
This optional configuration object is used as a way to load the Connect Widget directly to an institution login page. 


```js
const config = {
  selectedInstitution: {
    id: "5f2d08c060b92e2888287706", // the id of the institution to load
    auth_method: "internet_banking" // internet_banking or mobile_banking
  }
}

connect.setup(config);
```


## API Reference

### `setup(config: object)`
This method is used to load the widget onto the DOM, the widget remains hidden after invoking this function until the `open()` method is called.

It also allows an optional configuration object to be passed. When the setup method is called without a config object, the list of institutions will be displayed for a user to select from.

```js
const connect = new Connect({
  key: 'mono_public_key',
  scope: 'auth',
  data: { customer },
  onSuccess: ({code}) => console.log("code", code),
  onLoad: () => console.log("widget loaded successfully"),
  onClose: () => console.log("widget has been closed"),
  onEvent: (eventName, data) => {
    console.log(eventName);
    console.log(data);
  },
  reference: "random_string"
});

const config = {
  selectedInstitution: {
    id: "5f2d08c060b92e2888287706",
    auth_method: "internet_banking"
  }
}

connect.setup(config);
```

### `reauthorise(reauth_code: string)`
This methods loads the reauth widget unto the DOM, the widget remains hidden after invoking this function until the `open()` method is called.   

Reauthorisation of already authenticated accounts is done when MFA (Multi Factor Authentication) or 2FA is required by the institution or it has been setup by the user for security purposes before more data can be fetched from the account.

Check Mono [docs](https://docs.mono.co/reference/intro#reauth-code) on how to obtain `reauth_code` of an account.

```js
const connect = new Connect({
  key: 'mono_public_key',
  scope: 'auth',
  onSuccess: ({code}) => console.log("code", code),
});
connect.reauthorise("auth_fb8PP3jYA0");
```

| Parameter | Type     | Description                       |
| :-------- | :------- | :-------------------------------- |
| `reauth_code`      | `string` | **Required**. Reauth code of the account to be reauthorised |

> NOTE  
> the `reauthorise` method and `setup` method should be used separately. When used together, the last called method takes precedence.


### `open()`
This method makes the widget visible to the user.
```js
const connect = new Connect({
  key: 'mono_public_key',
  scope: 'auth',
  data: { customer },
  onSuccess: ({code}) => console.log("code", code),
});

connect.setup();
connect.open();
```

### `close()`
This method programatically hides the widget after it's been opened.
```js
const connect = new Connect({
  key: 'mono_public_key',
  scope: 'auth',
  data: { customer },
  onSuccess: ({code}) => console.log("code", code),
});

connect.setup();
connect.open();

// this closes the widget 5seconds after it has been opened
setTimeout(() => connect.close(), 5000)
```

### <a name="onEventCallback"></a> onEvent Callback

The onEvent callback returns two paramters, [eventName](#eventName) a string containing the event name and [data](#dataObject) an object that contains event metadata.

```js
const connect = new Connect({
  key: 'mono_public_key',
  scope: 'auth',
  data: { customer },
  onSuccess: ({code}) => console.log("code", code),
  onEvent: (eventName, data) => {
    if(eventName == "OPENED"){
      console.log("Widget opened");
    }else if(eventName == "INSTITUTION_SELECTED"){
      console.log("Selected institution: "+data.institution.name);
    }
    console.log(eventName)
    console.log(data)
  }
});

```

#### <a name="eventName"></a> `eventName`

Event names corespond to the `type` key returned by the raw event data. Possible options are in the table below.

| Event Name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| OPENED | Triggered when the user opens the Connect Widget. |
| EXIT | Triggered when the user closes the Connect Widget. |
| INSTITUTION_SELECTED | Triggered when the user selects an institution. |
| AUTH_METHOD_SWITCHED | Triggered when the user changes authentication method from internet to mobile banking, or vice versa. |
| SUBMIT_CREDENTIALS | Triggered when the user presses Log in. |
| ACCOUNT_LINKED | Triggered when the user successfully links their account. |
| ACCOUNT_SELECTED | Triggered when the user selects a new account. |
| ERROR | Triggered when the widget reports an error.|


#### <a name="dataObject"></a> `data`
The data object returned from the onEvent callback.

```js
{
  "reference": "ref_code_passed", // emitted in all events
  "errorType": "ERORR_NAME", // emitted in ERROR
  "errorMessage": "An error occurred.", // emitted in ERORR
  "mfaType": "OTP", // emitted in SUBMIT_MFA
  "prevAuthMethod": "internet_banking", // emitted in AUTH_METHOD_SWITCHED
  "authMethod": "mobile_banking", // emitted in AUTH_METHOD_SWITCHED and INSTITUTION_SELECTED
  "pageName": "MFA", // emitted in EXIT
  "selectedAccountsCount": 2 // emitted in ACCOUNT_SELECTED
  "institution": { // emitted in ACCOUNT_LINKED and INSTITUTION_SELECTED
    "id": "66059eO033be88012",
    "name": "GTBank"
  },   
  "timestamp": 1234567890 // emitted in all events
}
```
